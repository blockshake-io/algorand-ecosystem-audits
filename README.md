# Algorand Ecosystem Audits

This is an incomplete but growing collection of audit reports in the Algorand
ecosystem.

### Why collect all these audit reports?

This collection is collected for builders by builders and it is intended for
everyone who wants to learn from past audits to improve their own projects.


### How to contribute?

First, thank you for helping! Clone this repository, add a project / audit
report in this `README.md` file (the projects are ordered alphabetically), and
create a pull request. Too much work? Feel free to drop an email to
`kevin[at]blockshake[dot]io` and we will add the report for you.
